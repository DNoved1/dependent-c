* Unicode
* Handle allocation failure. Will likely delay this until compiler is
  bootstrapped, as polymorphism will make returning Maybe(T) values a lot
  easier, among other things.
* Dependent types rather than simply system f-omega.
* Require that depended-upon fields in structs be const since mutating them
  can change the size of the struct and invalidate and dependent fields. Maybe
  make an exception if the dependency is behind a pointer since it will prevent
  the first problem at least.
